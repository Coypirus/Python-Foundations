# High level language - Java, C, etc.
# Machine language - 1s and 0s

# Compiler: High level language --> Machine Language
# Compiler can also do High level language --> High level language

#In python:
# Source code --> Compiler --> Byte code -->
# Interpreter(Python Virtual Machine) --> Machine Language
# In java, also first compile with javac, then run with java.

# Interpreter reads every line one by one and then starts executing line by line

# Byte code allows for portability
# Virtual machine(PVM) runs the byte code and converts it

# cpython is the actual implementation of python(which is just a concept)
# The internal implementation of cpython is done in c.
